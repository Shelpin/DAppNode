What are the hardware minimum requirements for DAppNode to work ?? 
==================================================================

It depends on the use you want to do with it, basically the number  of nodes / DApps that you want to host in it. A basic setup is at least 4 gbs RAM (ideally 8GBs) and a 200 GBs SSD disk, it is important that the disk is SSD, otherwise writing speed wonÂ´t be able to cope with the ETH chain sync. On top  of that requirements add capacity as needed to run the nodes  you wish to run.
